case 1:

Machine A     |    <=================>     |Machine B


case 2:

                   human readable Lang.
Human Being A |    <=================>     | Human Being B  



case 3:
                   human readable Lang.
Human Being A |    <=================>     | Machine B ======> Raise a conflict, because                                                                      machine's don't understand                                                                        Human language




In this case we need something like mediator to translate b/w both of them(Human and Machine)

so here the  Mediator is ##Encoders

->Encoders act as mediators and convert english words to numeric values
   so that our human readable language converted to Machine Readable Lang. 

                                    converted to
 i.e`` [either words or sentences]    ========>   [Numeric/Binary form]
  
  
  Example:
  
       ['Survived', 'Not survived']   ======= Encoder =====>    [0, 1]
